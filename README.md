# This repo contains the backend code of Project CUL that has been migrated from Flask + SQLite to FastAPI + MongoDB for performance, and scalability.

# Shorly this will be hosted after I find and resolve all the bugs.

# Comments and docstrings are also yet to be added for many functions and will be added soon.
