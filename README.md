# Project CUL Backend

This repository contains the backend code of **Project CUL**, a command-line utility designed to manage C/C++ libraries efficiently.

> 🛠️ This version of the backend has been **migrated from Flask + SQLite** to **FastAPI + MongoDB** for better performance, scalability, and modularity.

CUL is being actively developed to become a fully modular, self-hostable, and open ecosystem for C/C++ module management. The backend plays a crucial role in powering both the CLI and Web UI.
